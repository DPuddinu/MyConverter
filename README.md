This is a simple currency converter using fixer.io API which offers a limited amount of 1000 calls/month.
A better solution would be using this XML from european central bank: 
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml?45e0ae28974a1e3ecd25b032e3a43104
it is updated daily and has no call limitations.

This project shows also a simple implementation of MVC pattern, Singleton and JsonRequest call with Volley library.
